              We have plans to expand on this payment structure in the upcoming weeks,

          Our goal is to work with our agents to build out a master sales 
          strategy that expands on our current model and allow us to pay out a lot more in the future.

          Youâ€™ll be able to join in our agent  group chat, you can ask our team any questions you may have there, as well as talk with other agents and trade ideas and what might be working for everyone else.
